				<h2>Introduction</h2><br>

				<p style="text-align:justify;">
					In this paper, (1) We introduce a task-driven neural network that accommodates diverse mesh
					triangulations/resolutions and manifold/non-manifold mesh models.
					(2) Our method demonstrates robust learning capabilities for mesh classification and semantic segmentation tasks,
					surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with limited data availability.
					(3) Extensive experiments were conducted, and all the results consistently validate the efficacy of our proposed approach.

							(a) Our method showcases a noteworthy ability to effectively handle mesh models with varying resolutions.
							Furthermore, it exhibits robustness when confronted with different triangulations, even in cases where the input model
							contains elongated and narrow triangles, as exemplified by the Vase model on the right.
							(b) We employ the red star as the reference for visualizing the correlation with other destination points.
							The color bar indicates that the weakest correlation is denoted by the color magenta.
							Remarkably, the correlation between the red star and the yellow star persists even when
							they are separated by a considerable distance.

						<p style="text-align:justify; text-align-last: center;">
							In semantic part segmentation tasks, it has been observed that the segmentation boundary (highlighted in red)
							tends to align with the negative minima of the principal curvatures. This alignment suggests that dihedral angles can serve
							as valuable indicators in semantic part segmentation.
